# Route
Implement a GraphProcessor to represent the US highway network as a graph for efficient route calculations. Key features include pathfinding, distance calculations, and connectivity checks. Use GraphDemo to visualize routing on this network. Test using JUnit and autograder for core functionality, with Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for shortest paths.
